The bunkers not only create a dramatic landscape, they also provide hours of challenges and excitement to golfers."

At that time, it was just a 9-hole golf course. The course was located within a British air base which served as both a Royal Air Force station (RAF Sembawang) and a Royal Naval Air Station (HMS Simbang)."

It is likely the more challenging one, following major changes by Peter Thomson in 2002. He built a sand-based course with an avant-garde drainage system perfectly suited to tropical storms that are common in this part of the world. Although surrounded by Singapore Harbour and the South China Sea, it is not a links-style course. Thanks to winning five Open Championships in the 50s and 60s, Thomson has an edge on British seaside courses - almost winning five consecutively in the 50s - and integrates this style as much as possible. The New course is crafted within the natural jungle. This landscape, together with Thomson's expertise, create an impressively large course (over 6500 metres) with lush rough that helps when you stray off the course"

It features a large number of challenging water hazards. It offers undulating fairways, as well as strategic bunkers and water hazards. The emphasis here is on well placed drives which will be rewarded. On the other hand, playing wildly will be disastrous.

Named after orchids, the Aranda, Vanda and Dendro, courses feature acres of immaculately manicured fairways and greens.Tee-off on gentle rolling hills, conquer the strategically placed bunkers and drive a shot along the glassy waterways. Occasionally, be greeted by brilliantly-coloured flowers swaying in the cool breeze that sweeps through the reservoir."
